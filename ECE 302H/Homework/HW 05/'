\begin{problem}

In rf circuits, it is very important to ''match'' the resistance of loads (the things that receive rf power)
with signal sources. When we speak of the ''resistance'' of the signal source, we mean its Thevenin
equivalent resistance. Let’s examine an rf ''power splitter'' which has one signal source $v _{in}$ with output
resistance $R_0$ and it sends a signals to two loads, each a resistor of value $R_0$. A power splitting circuit
composed of three resistors of value $R_1$ may be included. The three ports labeled are understood to be
from the labeled point to ground.

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

Explain why the splitting circuit is necessary. In other words, imagine the two loads simply
connected in parallel to Port 1. What equivalent resistance would the source see, i.e. what is
the equivalent resistance to the right of ''Port 1''? Does it match the source’s output resistance?

\item

Now analyze the full circuit. In particular, find the Thevenin Equivalent resistance from the
perspective of each of the three ports. For Port 1, this includes everything but the signal source
and its output impedance. For Port 2, this includes everything except Load 2. For Port 3, this
includes everything except Load 3. Show that if $R_1 = R_0/3$, then the source and each load
''sees'' a matched Thevenin resistance looking into the rest of the circuit.

(if you take ECE 363M Microwave and Radio Frequency Engineering, you’ll learn more about why this
matching is so important)

\end{enumerate}

\begin{soln}
\end{soln}

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

If we imagine the two loads simply being in parallel to Port 1 without
the power splitter, the equivalent resistance to the right of Port 1 would
just be two resistors of $R_0$ in parallel.

\begin{align*}
R _{eq} &= \frac{R_0 R_0}{R_0 + R_0} \\
R _{eq} &= \frac{R_0^2}{2R_0} \\
R _{eq} &= \boxed{\frac{R_0}{2}}
\end{align*}

The output Thevenin resistance of the source $R_0$ does not equal $R_0 / 2$
so the it's not matched. Hence why the circuit splitting is necessary.

\item

The Thevenin Equivalent resistance from the perspective of Port 1 would be,

\begin{align*}
R _{eq} &= R_1 + \frac{(R_1 + R_0)(R_1 + R_0)}{R_1 + R_0 + R_1 + R_0} \\
R _{eq} &= R_1 + \frac{(R_1 + R_0)^{2}}{2(R_1 + R_0)} \\
R _{eq} &= R_1 + \frac{R_1 + R_0}{2} \\
R _{eq} &= \boxed{\frac{3}{2} R_1 + \frac{1}{2} R_0}
\end{align*}

The Thevenin Equivalent resistance from the perspective of Port 2 and 3 would be,

\begin{align*}
R _{eq} &= R_1 + \frac{(R_1 + R_0)(R_1 + R_0)}{R_1 + R_0 + R_1 + R_0} \\
R _{eq} &= R_1 + \frac{(R_1 + R_0)^{2}}{2(R_1 + R_0)} \\
R _{eq} &= R_1 + \frac{R_1 + R_0}{2} \\
R _{eq} &= \boxed{\frac{3}{2} R_1 + \frac{1}{2} R_0}
\end{align*}

\begin{remark*}
Notice that they are the same.
\end{remark*}

If we plug in $R_1 = \frac{R_0}{3}$,

\begin{align*}
R _{eq} &= \frac{3}{2} R_1 + \frac{1}{2} R_0 \\
R _{eq} &= \frac{3}{2} \frac{1}{3} R_1 + \frac{1}{2} R_0 \\
R _{eq} &= \boxed{R_0}
\end{align*}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}

The circuit for this problem is similar to what you will use in Lab 7 to study Op Amp gain and also FETs.
The circuit consists of a function generator with an output impedance of $\SI{50}{\ohm}$ (the source plus
$R _{FNG}$) feeding an amplifier based on an op-amp. In the amplifier, one of the resistors ($\SI{1000}{\ohm}$) has a
MOSFET in parallel with it. $R _{FNG}$, $ R _{FET}$, and the $\SI{1000}{\ohm}$ resistor ($R_1$) collectively have a value of $R_s$.
We will learn in a couple of weeks that a MOSFET, in certain operating conditions, can be modeled as a
variable resistor $R _{FET}$. The amplifier supplies a load whose equivalent resistance is $\SI{5}{\kilo \ohm}$. The Op
Amp supply voltage is $\SI{5}{\volt}$.

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

Calculate the value of the equivalent resistance $R_s$ (which is a combination of $R _{FNG}$, $R _{FET}$ and
$\SI{1000}{\ohm}$, as shown in the figure) and the output voltage of the Op Amp $v_0$ for $R_f$ = $\SI{200}{\ohm}$ and $R_1$
= $\SI{1000}{\ohm}$. Assume $R _{FNG} = \SI{50}{\ohm}$ and take $R _{FET}$ to be $\SI{60}{\ohm}$.

\item

Repeat with $R _{FET} = \SI{2}{\kilo \ohm}$ and all other resistors and $v_s$ being the same.

\item

For $R _{FET}$ = \SI{60}{\ohm}, the input voltage (which is initially at $\SI{-0.2}{\volt}$) is increased in magnitude. What
is the maximum input voltage magnitude for which the Op Amp still operates in the linear
region?

\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{2.png}
\end{figure}

\end{problem}

\pagebreak

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

Solve for the equivalent resistance $R_s$,

\begin{align*}
R_s &= R _{FNG} + \frac{1000R _{FET}}{1000 + R _{FET}} \\
R_s &= 50 + \frac{1000 (60)}{1000 + 60} \\
R_s &= \frac{5650}{53} = \boxed{\SI{106.604}{\ohm}}
\end{align*}

Solve for $V_o$ using node analysis,

\begin{align*}
\frac{-0.2 - 0}{R_s} &= \frac{0 - V_o}{R_f} \\
\frac{-0.2}{R_s} &= \frac{- V_o}{R_f} \\
V_o &= 0.2 \frac{R_f}{R_s} \\
V_o &= 0.2 \frac{200}{106.604} = \boxed{\SI{375.221}{\milli \volt}}
\end{align*}

\item

Find new $R_s$ value for $R _{FET} = \SI{2}{\kilo \ohm}$,

\begin{align*}
R_s &= R _{FNG} + \frac{1000R _{FET}}{1000 + R _{FET}} \\
R_s &= 50 + \frac{1000 (2000)}{1000 + 2000} \\
R_s &= \frac{2150}{3} = \boxed{\SI{716.667}{\ohm}}
\end{align*}

Plug in $R_s$ to find new $V_o$,

\begin{align*}
V_o &= 0.2 \frac{R_f}{R_s} \\
V_o &= 0.2 \frac{200}{716.667} = \boxed{\SI{55.814}{\milli \volt}}
\end{align*}

\item

The Op Amp can output a maximum voltage of $\SI{5}{\volt}$ across it's output terminal. We can 
rewrite the earlier equation to solve for $V _{in}$ from the source instead of $V _{o}$,

\begin{align*}
V_o &= 0.2 \frac{200}{106.604} \\
5 &= V _{in} \frac{200}{106.604} \\
V _{in} &= 5 \frac{106.604}{200} = \boxed{\SI{2.665}{\volt}}
\end{align*}

\begin{problem}

A negative resistor is an object whose current is proportional to its voltage $i = -v/R$ where the
constant of proportionality $-R$ is a negative number.

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

Calculate the power in a negative resistor of value $-R$ (where $R$ itself is positive, such that $-R$
is negative) as a function of the voltage applied to it and use it to show that a negative resistor
always \textit{supplies} power.

\item

It is impossible for a passive component to supply net power, so true negative resistors do not
exist in real life. However, it is possible to synthesize circuits that behave as negative resistors.
Consider the circuit in the Figure. Calculate its input current $I_S$ as a function of its input voltage
$V_S$ and show that the circuit emulates a negative resistor of value $-R$. Calculate the value of $R$
assuming an ideal op amp.

\item

Suppose that this circuit (the op amp and the three resistors) were placed in series with a real
resistor of value $+R$ – what would the net resistance of the series combination be? How about
if they were placed in parallel?

\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{3.png}
\end{figure}

\end{problem}

\pagebreak

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

Recall that we know power to be $P = i \times V$. Subtitute in the current of the negative
resistor to solve for it's power as a function of the voltage applied to it,

\begin{align*}
P(V) &= i \times V \\
P(V) &= \frac{V}{-R} V \\
P(V) &= \boxed{- \frac{V^2}{R}}
\end{align*}

From this equation we can see that a negative resistory always \textit{supplies} power because
$P$ remains negative regardless of voltage polraity since it is squared.

\item

Use node analysis to solve for $I_S$,

\begin{align*}
\frac{V_o - V_S}{R_2} &= \frac{V_S - 0}{R_1} \\
\frac{V_o}{R_2} - \frac{V_S}{R_2} &= \frac{V_S}{R_1} \\
V_o &= V_S \frac{R_2}{R_1} + V_S \\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
I_S &= \frac{V_S - V_o}{R_3} \\
I_S &= \frac{V_S}{R_3} - \frac{V_o}{R_3} \\
I_S &= \frac{V_S}{R_3} - V_S \frac{R_2}{R_1 R_3} - \frac{V_S}{R_3} \\
I_S &= \boxed{- V_S \frac{R_2}{R_1 R_3}} \\
\end{align*}

From the equation $i = - v / R$,

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{R} &= \frac{R_2}{R_1 R_3} \\
R &= \boxed{\frac{R_1 R_3}{R_2}}
\end{align*}

\item

In series, we know $R _{eq} = R_1 + R_2$,

\begin{align*}
R _{eq} &= R - R = \boxed{\SI{0}{\ohm}}
\end{align*}

In parallel, we know $\frac{1}{R _{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$,

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{R _{eq}} &= \frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R} \\
\frac{1}{R _{eq}} &= 0 \\
R _{eq} &\rightarrow \boxed{\infty}
\end{align*}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}

Feedback can be used to create a circuit that behaves as a current source. This is known as a
transconductance amplifier, i.e. one that converts a voltage in one place into a current (''conductance'')
in another place (''trans''). Consider the circuit below with an op-amp arranged in feedback with a
MOSFET. Assume that the drain (top) of the MOSFET is connected to some circuit (not open-circuited),
but that we don’t know what that circuit is. The output current of the circuit $i_o$ is the drain-source
current of the MOSFET, indicated by an arrow near the top of the diagram.

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

Assume that the MOSFET behaves such that the higher the voltage applied to its gate (on the
left), the higher the current that will flow from its drain (top) to its source (bottom). Does the
configuration below qualify as negative feedback? Explain.

\item

If the amplifier gain is infinite, what will the voltage $v_1$ be? Other than the assumption above,
do you need to know the IV characteristics of the MOSFET or of the load circuit (not shown) in
order to solve for $v_1$?

\item

What is $i_o$? Other than the assumption above, do you need to know the IV characteristics of
the MOSFET or of the load circuit not shown in order to solve for $i_o$?

\item

What accounts for the circuit’s remarkable lack of dependence on the details of its components
or the load connected to it? In other words, explain how the circuit can maintain constant $i_o$
even if you replaced the MOSFET with a different MOSFET with a different IV characteristic?

\item

What are the input resistance and the Thevenin equivalent output resistance of the circuit?

\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}

A transimpedance (or transresistance) amplifier is shown in the Figure. The name comes from
''resistance,'' which turns a current into a voltage, and ''trans,'' which means that the current in one
place gets converted into a voltage in another place.

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

Calculate the transimpedance of the circuit, $r = V_o / I _{in}$, assuming that the op-amp gain is $A$.
Then let $A \rightarrow \infty$. Use the $A \rightarrow \infty$ result for the rest of the problem.

\item

Often $I _{in}$ is provided by a relatively poor current source. When learning about Thevenin and
Norton equivalents, we learned that a good current source has near-infinite output resistance,
while a poor current source has an output resistance that is large but not negligibly so. We also
learned that an object acts most like a good current source when it the load resistance is much
lower than the circuit’s output resistance. What is the equivalent input resistance of the op amp
circuit, i.e. everything to the right of $I _{in}$? Is this a good circuit to load an imperfect current
source?

\item

This circuit might appear to be overkill. One might wonder why not just run $I _{in}$ into a grounded
resistor of value $r$ to get the same current-to-voltage conversion factor. Explain why this would
not be as good of an idea.

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

Perform node analysis on $V_-$,

\begin{align*}
I _{in} &= \frac{V_- - V_o}{R_f} \\
I _{in} &= \frac{V_-}{R_f} - \frac{V_o}{R_f} \\
V_o &= A(V_+ - V_-) \\
V_+ &= 0 \\
V_o &= -AV_- \\
V_- &= - \frac{V_o}{A} \\
I _{in} &= - \frac{V_o}{A R_f} - \frac{V_o}{R_f} \\
I _{in} &= - V_o \left(\frac{1}{A R_f} + \frac{1}{R_f}\right) \\
I _{in} &= - V_o \left(\frac{1 + A}{A R_f} \right) \\
\frac{V_o}{I _{in}} &= \boxed{r = - \frac{A R_f}{1 + A}}
\end{align*}

Take $A \rightarrow \infty$,

\begin{align*}
r &= \lim _{A \rightarrow \infty} - \frac{A R_f}{1 + A} \\
r &= \lim _{A \rightarrow \infty} - \frac{R_f}{\frac{1}{A} + 1} \\
r &= \boxed{- R_f}
\end{align*}

\item

Perform node analysis on $V_-$,

\begin{align*}
I _{in} &= \frac{V_- - V_o}{R_f} \\
V_o &= - AV_- \\
I _{in} &= \frac{V_- + AV_-}{R_f} \\
I _{in} &= \frac{V_- (1 + A)}{R_f} \\
\frac{V_-}{I _{in}} &= \frac{R_f}{1 + A}
\end{align*}

As $A \rightarrow \infty$,

\begin{align*}
\frac{V_-}{I _{in}} &= \boxed{R _{in} = 0}
\end{align*}

In this case, the load or input resistance is 0, which quite literaly is
the best case scenario for loading an imperfect current source.

Duality

\begin{enumerate}[\alph*)]

\item

An op amp is a 3-terminal object: two input terminals (+) and (-) and one output terminal.
Consider the following statements about op amps: \textit{An op amp measures the voltage across the
two input terminals $v_d$ and produces an output voltage that is proportional to the input, $v_o = A v_d$ 
Real op amps are modeled as having some input resistance $R_i$ (between + and ― ) and
some output resistance $R_o$ (in series with the output voltage $A v_d$)}. Ideal op amps have $R_i \rightarrow \infty$,
$R_o \rightarrow 0$, and $A \rightarrow \infty$. Based on this description, what would the dual of an op amp be? Copy these
statements, replacing words as needed to exchange the role of voltage and current. Draw a
circuit model to represent the op amp’s dual (both non-ideal and ideal).

\item

What is the dual of an open switch? What is the dual of a closed switch? Suppose a switch is
turned on and off at a frequency $f$ (period $T$). Further suppose that the switch spends a fraction
of the period $DT$ ($D$ < 1) in the on position and the other fraction $(1 - D)T$ in the off position.
(The on-fraction $D$ is called the ''duty cycle''). If you took the dual of this switch, what would the
dual’s duty cycle $D'$ be?

\item

A poor man’s Digital to Analog converter is shown in the figure, in which two switches are
alternately turned on such that only one switch is closed at a time. The top switch is closed with
a duty cycle of $D$ and the lower switch is closed whenever the top switch is open (i.e., a duty
cycle of $(1 - D)$). This circuit involves a component we have not yet studied (but that we
mentioned in lecture) called a \textit{capacitor}, which has a value of $C$, units of \textit{Farads} $= \frac{C}{V} = \frac{A \times s}{V}$, and
a component law $i_c = C \frac{d v_c}{dt}$. You’re not prepared to derive this circuit’s operation yet, but the
circuit’s function is to cause $v_c$ to be equal to $DV _{in}$. By adjusting the duty cycle of the top
switch (and the corresponding duty cycle of the lower switch), the output voltage can be made
to be any voltage less than $V _{in}$. There’s a good chance you will implement this circuit in ECE
319K.

What would the component law be for the dual of a capacitor? Research what kind of
component has that law. What would the dual of this circuit be? What would the dual’s
function be? What units would all of the components have, and what would the duty cycles of
the switches be?
